- 👋 Hi, I’m Beck!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python (and likely many more languages in the future) through the Software Development program @ Keyin College :D
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on casual projects when I have time outside of school
- 📫 How to reach me either by email at rebecca.pond@keyin.com or b.pond26@proton.me.
